                    <div className="text-xl font-normal tracking-tight">
                        <p>I am a recent Computer Science Graduate from the <a href={"https://uh.edu"} className="link">University of Houston</a> (UH). My love for programming began with a commonly known application, Microsoft PowerPoint. Sounds weird at first, right? Well, let me explain!</p><br/>
                        <p>Growing up, I was drawn to technology, or more specifically using technology to solve problems and create simple, yet great user experiences. In 2012, I started my journey with programming by discovering PowerPoint Operating Systems (PPTOSes) through YouTube exploration and experimentation. This led me to a community which other individuals who shared the same interests.</p><br/>
                        <p>I learned Visual Basic for Applications (my first programming language) and used Microsoft PowerPoint&apos;s functionality to create faux operating systems, with a login system, applications such as web browsing, calculator, music player, and similar. Over that time, I created multiple PPTOSes and I was co-founder and head Administrator of the <a className="link" href="https://pptos.fandom.com/">PPTOS Wiki</a>. The wiki still sees about 300 monthly visitors.</p><br/>
                        <p>Since then, I went to the University of Houston to major in Computer Science in which I have gained a lot of knowledge regarding programming, including Software Engineering, Data Structures & Algorithms, and languages such as C++ and Python. During my time at UH, I worked in several university positions in which I always introduced my technical skills to make some of my processes either more efficient or automated.</p><br/>
                        <p className="font-semibold">I am seeking a full-time Software Engineering role where I can further my skills and help a company continue their mission and achieve their goals.</p>
